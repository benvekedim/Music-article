# Listeners and Musician



There is music in every aspect of our lives; When we want to have fun, relax or remember the memories that it evokes to us, etc., etc., we listen to music because it is one of the most beautiful tools that express our emotions. When we start listening to music, almost all parts of our brain are affected.


At the same time, music is one of the best ways to understand and express emotions. A study in this area found something like this:
In 2010, he was asked by Adam J. Lonsdale and Adrian C. North, "Why do we listen to music?" One of the popular answers is what we listen to for "Music to Manage the Mood." Sometimes this song can be a cheerful song or a sad song.

#### So why do we compose music?

I can answer this question as a musician. I usually write melody when I'm feeling emotional. We want to explore my feelings and share them with those who listen to them. It's nice for people to understand us and be able to share the same feelings with them.

#### What is the process before sharing the song with the audience?

Artists listen to the song themselves perhaps hundreds of times before sharing it. He changes the parts he doesn't like. We do it together with their friends. Together a decision is made. Perhaps the hardest part is listening through the eyes of the listener.

#### How do you share the song with the listener?
You don't need a record label if you're an independent musician. We can deal with and share with any distributor.

#### How do listeners discover artists?
Social media, the environment, algorithms, and what people prefer play a big role. The important question here is can we make choices?


#### Do you remember your preference on any topic last?
No. Because I don't think I'm free in my choices. Social media or algorithms can predict what we might prefer and manipulate us in any way they want. Our environment is also affected. We are only one point in the data set. A small anecdote about data analysis is as follows: In the data set, the outliers that do not match the average are either deleted or replaced with the average. I learned this when I was writing my Mathematics thesis.

#### Why should we prefer independent music?
In the era we live in now, people are trying to make it uniform. Everyone is asked to look like the average. Independent music serves as a savior for both listeners and musicians.

#### What inspires you when you make songs?
From the songs I listen to, the movies I watch or the books I read, it is an inspiration for me. One of the films, Tarkovsky's Offret is a film that impressed me. The Growlers, who made independent music, influenced me musically.


#### Why do you think listeners listen to any song?
I think they're listening to express themselves or to be happy.

#### What's next for you in terms of upcoming music/shows?
At the moment, there is no such thing. I continue to compose my songs.I would love to play in shows.
